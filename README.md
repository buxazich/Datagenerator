Hello all! 
Here you can find the Classification Tree program itself. See "Classification Tree Code.ipynb".
Synthetic data generation and experiments, both on synthetic data and UCI repo data. 
Please note that in experiments and tables, there are additional criteria ('gini', 'gini sklearn', 'entropy sklearn') that were removed from the article itself. 
Every experiment denoted in the article could be found in the file "Data generation_and_experiments.ipynb".

Thank you! 
Please email azabekniyazov@gmail.com if you have any questions :)
